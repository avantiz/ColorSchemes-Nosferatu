> A dark theme for [Sublime Text] (https://sublimetext.io) - made specially for nocturnal coders (other ports coming soon, but any text editor with .tmTheme themes support will works, too).

## _"Do you have plans in make a light version of this theme?"_
No, Nosferatu dies in light.

Jokes aside, this a personal, uncommitted project: i simply was bored and tired with all dark color schemes stuff in the market and one night i decided build one, inspired in ExpressionEngine CMS colors, my credit card from Nubank and my computer desktop setup purple colors (NZXT H510i).

I made it a nice color scheme, easy to read code under low-light conditions and for tired eyes - and i hope with you like it.
